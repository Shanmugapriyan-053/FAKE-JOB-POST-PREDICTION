In recent years, many people apply for jobs through online platforms like job portals and social media. But, this has also increased the number of fake job postings, where scammers cheat job seekers for money or personal details. 
To solve this issue, our project uses deep learning techniques like (BERT) and (RoBERTa) to automatically detect fake job ads based on their content. 
We also handle the imbalance in real vs fake job data using advanced methods like SMOTE, which helps improve the model's accuracy in catching scams. This system aims to protect users from falling into job fraud traps
